# MQTT Chat App

That sounds like a real challenge. Yep, I'm talking about the app I used to test out MQTT chat. Clone the app from the repository if you're feeling adventurous.

I did put together a tutorial chapter, trying to give at least some information and tips how to get it running on macOS and in the iOS Simulator simultaneously. But here's the kickerâ€”I couldn't crack the Android security issue regarding certificates. Sorry, Android fans, you're on your own with this one.

So, what's the verdict? Well, let's just say this app is tailor-made for the daredevils among us, the ones who thrive on a good challenge. If you've got a knack for troubleshooting and a touch of masochism, then by all means, dive right in. But for the rest of us mere mortals? Maybe stick to apps that don't require a crash course in programming just to send a message.

## Usage of the repository

Now here's a hurdle: I'm not exactly a pro at downloading repositories and making them spring to life with just one magic install command (especially when it comes to this complex amalgamation of Rust, Flutter, Flutter-Rust Bridge, Android, and Xcode). Nope, no hand-holding from me on this one. Proceed at your own risk, folks. You've been warned.

My recommendation: Build the app from scratch as you have learned in the tutorial chapters of [IOTA for Flutter](https://iota-for-flutter.github.io/tutorial/). Copy the most important code snippets for Flutter and Rust from the MQTT Chat App repository and paste it into your app.
