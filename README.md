# MQTT Chat App

So, here's the scoop: I decided to dip my toes into the world of app development and, oh boy, did I stumble upon a gem. Picture this—a quirky little app riddled with more bugs than a cheap motel. Yep, I'm talking about the one I used to test out MQTT chat. You can catch all the action on YouTube if you're feeling adventurous.

Now, I did put together a tutorial chapter, trying to give at least some information and tips how to get it running on macOS and in the iOS Simulator simultaneously. But here's the kicker—I couldn't crack the Android security issue regarding certificates. Sorry, Android fans, you're on your own with this one.

So, what's the verdict? Well, let's just say this app is tailor-made for the daredevils among us, the ones who thrive on a good challenge. If you've got a knack for troubleshooting and a touch of masochism, then by all means, dive right in. But for the rest of us mere mortals? Maybe stick to apps that don't require a crash course in programming just to send a message.
